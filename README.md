# Baby Crying Detector ðŸ‘¶ðŸ”Š

An Arduino-based system that detects loud sounds (like a baby's cry) and alerts the user via an LED and LCD screen.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was built as part of an academic electronics module at ENSTTIC. It simulates a basic baby monitoring device that reacts to sound levels crossing a set threshold.

When crying is detected:
- A **LED light turns ON**
- An **LCD displays "Sound Detected"**

When there is no crying:
- The LED turns OFF
- The LCD displays "No Sound Detected"

##  Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- Sound Sensor Module
- LED + 220Î© resistor
- 20x4 LCD screen
- Breadboard & jumper wires

---

##  How It Works

1. **Microphone** picks up sound waves.
2. Signal is **amplified** and passed to a **comparator**.
3. If the sound level exceeds the threshold (set by a **potentiometer**), output is HIGH.
4. Arduino reads the sensor signal:
   - If HIGH â†’ Turn on LED & show "Sound Detected" on LCD
   - If LOW â†’ Turn off LED & show "No Sound Detected"

---

##  Code Highlights

- Uses `setup()` to initialize pins and LCD
- Continuously reads the sound sensor in `loop()`
- Responds in real-time with feedback on LCD + LED
